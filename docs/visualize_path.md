# KiCad Path visualisation Guide

## Overview

The PCB Path visualisation Method allows you to:

1. Mark a specific Path through the circuit in your PCB File
2. Use another Layer for every Path (up to 11) then some Paths should be deleted again
3. See how components are connected on the actual Layout
4. Delete chosen Paths again with a tool

## Using Path Visualisation Features

### Highlight Paths 


```
Can you highlight The Path were the error occurs?
```

This will provide:
- colored Tracks in the PCB File in the color of the Layer that was chosen by Claude

- at first Eco Layer 1 and Eco Layer 2 will be chosen afterward all User Layers are used 
- you can choose your own Layer
- when deleting a Path only the Path is deleted, no other components on the Layer
